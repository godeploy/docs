Once you open your lab you will see the labs associated with each module.

**Note**:  Not every mode has a lab associated with it.  You should ask your instructor if unsure.

Click Launch Lab with the Module/Lab you wish to start the launch page will be displayed.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note**:  Do not refresh or close your browser during this process.  It may cause your lab to be stuck in a starting state.  The process can take up to 2 minutes.
{% endhint %}

Once your lab is launched you are ready to continue with your labs.
