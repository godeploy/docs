# Authoring Lessons - Top Tips

I learned a few techniques after producing the first course:

* To ensure consistent volume, do not stop recording if you make a mistake. Just stop to recompose yourself, and say it again. Later you can edit out the mistakes and silences. I found it hard to speak at the exact same loudness if I stopped talking for too long.
* I don't like to script my talks, but I noticed that I re-record a lot when I tried to define a concept. So now I write down the definitions and edit them to my liking before I record. By reading out the written definitions I can often do it in one take, which is a major time saver.
* I love my [Kinesis keyboard](http://amzn.to/1fiVgxu), but it makes a lot of noise when I type, and it's a bit distracting in the video. So I type on the keyboard of my laptop instead.
* When doing demos, don't worry too much about talking and typing at the same time. I type, and then explain. Later I split the video and audio tracks in Camtasia and splice them back together so I am talking over the demo.
* When you are talking during the demos, do not jitter the mouse! It makes the video splicing much harder.
