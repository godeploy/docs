# Keyboard language

When using the lab interface, there is some support for international keyboards and languages, however, you may need to change settings on your local machine, the browser, but not usually inside the Virtual Machine as the LMS portal will do the translation.

**Requirements for International Keyboards to Work:**

The machine in which you are accessing the labs \(ie your **local machine\)** must be set to the desired language.  This can be changed in control panel or by clicking the language icon on the taskbar:

The language set on your local system & keyboard will be taken into the Virtual Machine.
