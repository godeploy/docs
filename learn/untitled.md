### **What content can you get involved with?**

_**Levels**_

Firstly, we should explain our levels of content:

| Level | Code | Explanation and/or Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Foundational | 100 | Explains the basic concept |
| Intermediate | 200 | Expands on the basic concepts but does not duplicate |
| Associate | 300 | Advanced technical detail |
| Expert | 400 | Highly technical with depth to the content |
| Deep Dive | 500 | Deeply technical and usually is a much longer duration than the above |

#### _Modalities_

Many of you will have already come across the concept of learning paths. These comprise of multiple modalities giving users a diverse learning experience.

* Lessons \(Videos\)
* Theory \(includes textual content which should reinforce videos and not replace it
* Hands on labs
* Quiz’s \(not graded / assessed and more fun\)
* Assessments \(graded and based on performance based testing\)
* Exams \(graded and based on theory and/or an assessment\)
* Once a user has completed a learning path they may earn a badge which can be shared on social media.

You do not necessarily need to create a learning path.  You may just wish to create a lesson or a hands on lab.
