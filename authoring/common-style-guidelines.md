# Common Style Guidelines

This section includes guidelines for preventing common errors in word choice and sentence formation. The list contains some of the most common errors in grammar, language, style, and formatting. Use this section as a quick reference as you write or edit. For more comprehensive information on, and guidelines for writing about technical information, please see the each vendors Manual of Style to remain compliant with accessibility requirements.



| Use | Do Not Use | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| VMs | VM's | Do not use an apostrophe when you mean plural.  This is the possessive form. |
| Red, white, and blue | Red, white and blue | Always include the serial comma, which is the comma before a coordinating conjunction such as "and" or "or." |
| In Server Manager, click **Manage**, and click **Add Roles and Features**. | In Server Manager, click **Manage**, then click **Add Roles and Features**. | _Then_ is not a coordinate conjunction and thus cannot correctly join two independent clauses. Use _and_ or another coordinate conjunction or _then_ with a semicolon or another conjunctive adverb to connect independent clauses in, for example, two-part procedural steps.  This is one of the most common grammatical errors in lab documents. |
| Some applications are unable to use expanded memory. | Some applications are unable to utilize expanded memory. | Do not use _utilize_ as a synonym for _use_. _Utilize_ means "to find a practical use for." |
| On the File menu, click **Open**. | On the File menu, select **Open**. | Use _click_ rather than _choose_ or _select_ to refer to the user action of issuing a command or setting an option. |
| On the View menu, point to **Toolbars**, and then click **Formatting**. | On the File menu, choose **Open**.  Click on **Save**. | When dealing with menus and submenus, do not use _click on_, only _click_. |
| Check the **Print all pages** check box. | Check the **Print all pages** checkbox. | If using the term check box, this is two words. |
| For more information about... | For information on... | In cross-references, use _about_, not _on_. |
| To ..., click …. | Click … to.... | Begin the sentence with "To". |
| web, website | Web, web site | web in lower case, and website all one word. |
| All caps for AM, PM, and key names, such as CTRL, ALT, and DELETE | Small caps, or title case. | Note no periods in AM and PM although acceptable using periods \(full stops\) is dated. |
| The **Save as** dialog box appears. | The **Save as** dialog box displays. | Do not use _display_ as an intransitive verb. Use _appears_ or, only if necessary, the passive _is displayed_. |
| Type the following code, and then press ENTER. | Type the following code, and then press ENTER: | End the introductory sentence with a period, not a colon. This is a recent change to the MMS.  Sentences introducing code samples are now always ended with a period, not a colon. |
| To install the program, do the following: | To install the program, perform the following steps: | If _following_ is the last word before what it introduces, follow it with a colon.  This is a recent change to the MSTP. |
| Use Intense Emphasis style for user interface elements with which a user interacts. | Do not use bold for emphasis. | See the relevant section in this style guide for complete guidelines regarding bold font.  Do not use bold for UI elements that are used as reference. |
| Spell out acronyms at first mention | None | ie MEM \(Microsoft Endpoint Manager\) |
| computer | machine | Do not use _machine_ when you mean _computer_.  While this term is common among software developers and IT Pros, it is not acceptable per MMS. |
| You will need to supply information about applications that you want to run with Windows. | You will need to supply information about applications which you want to run with Windows. | _That_ and _which_ are often confused. Be sure to use the appropriate word. _That_ introduces a restrictive clause, which is a clause that is essential for the sentence to make sense. A restrictive clause often defines the noun or phrase preceding it and is not separated from it by a comma. In general, do include the word _that_ in restrictive clauses, even though in some clauses the sentence may be clear without it. Including _that_ prevents ambiguity and helps translators understand the sentence. |
| Your package contains the subsidiary information card, which you can use to obtain device drivers or local technical support. | You will need to supply information about applications you want to run with Windows. | _Which_ introduces a nonrestrictive clause, which is a clause that could be omitted without affecting the meaning of the sentence. It is preceded by a comma. Nonrestrictive clauses often contain auxiliary or parenthetical information. |
| Type your password, and then press ENTER. | Enter your password, and then click **OK**. | Do not use as a synonym for _type_ except to indicate that a user can either type or click a selection from, say, a list in a combo box. |
| Wait for the computer to restart, and then log on as **Administrator** with the password **Passw0rd**. | Wait for the computer to restart, and then logon as **Administrator** with the password **Passw0rd**. | The verb form is two words, _log on_ or _log off_. As a noun or adjective, use one word, no hyphen: _logon_ or _logoff_. |
| Windows Server® 2019  Hyper-V™ | Note the use of ® and TM. Once this has been spelled out correctly, you can then reference Hyper-V, or Windows Server Hyper-V. | Refer to the Trademarks section for a link to how to use different vendor trademarks. |
| cloud | Cloud | Note that cloud is lower case. |
| On the Start menu, navigate to **All Programs\Microsoft Office\Word 2019**. | On the Start menu, navigate to **All Programs/Office/Word 2019**. | Do not use / for Start menu commands. |
| In the Navigation pane, expand **contoso.com/branch offices/Vancouver/sales**, and then in the Details pane, click **Tom**. | In the Navigation pane, navigate to **contoso.com\branch offices\Vancouver\sales**, and then in the Details pane, click **Tom**. | In a Management Console, use _expand_ for navigating tree structures, and use a /.  Make sure you reference the Navigation pane and the Details pane.  Do not use a \. |
| On the File menu, click **Open**. | On the File menu, click **Open...**.  On the File menu, click **Open\(...\)**. | In the user interface, an ellipsis is typically used to show truncation, as in a program name, or to indicate on menus and in dialog boxes that a dialog box will appear to obtain more information from the user. Do not use an ellipsis in this context in documentation. |
| Right-click **XXX**, and then click **Properties**. | Right-click **XXX**, and then select **Properties**.  Right-click **XXX**, and then choose **Properties**. | When you right-click something, you are presented with a context menu. You _click_ items on a context menu, rather than choosing or selecting them. |

### Acronyms and Initialisms

The term, acronym, is used when the letters can be pronounced as a word. Initialism is the correct term to use when the first letters cannot be pronounced as a word. HOL or ILL can be either.

Spell these out at first mention, for example: System Center Virtual Machine Manager \(VMM\). Note that, in this example, the Microsoft initialism is VMM, not SCVMM. One often sees both, but by visiting Microsoft Docs pages, you can see that the correct initialism is VMM. 

#### Trademarks

You can usually confirm trademarks using different vendors websites. 

#### Bold Formatting

In this document style, only UI elements that a user interacts with should be bold. Ensure that the UI element is bold, but any punctuation following the UI term is not bold.

#### Periods \(Full Stops\)

It is acceptable to miss a period at the end of a sentence if it ends with a password such as:

Enter the following password **&s6&90saiis9\***

#### Initial Caps

Initial caps mean capitalising the first letter of a word. Use initial caps for:

* File names. Internal caps are OK for readability, as in MyFile.doc. The file extension should be lowercase. Examples: MyTaxFile.doc, Oleaut.dll.
* Agenda items in slide presentations
* Folder names \(internal caps are OK for readability\)
* Mode names \(Break mode\)
* Named views \(Gantt view\)
* Named windows \(the Edit window\)
* Proper names \(the Insert menu\)
* “Wizard” when used as part of a proper name of a wizard \(for example, the Answer Wizard\)

#### Sentence Case

In sentence case, you capitalise only the first letter in a sentence or phrase. Use sentence case for all task titles.

#### Title Case

Use this for the exercise titles and lab titles.

* Capitalise all nouns, verbs \(including _is_ and other forms of _be_\), adverbs \(including _than_ and _when_\), adjectives \(including _this_ and _that_\), and pronouns \(including _its_\).
* Capitalise the first and last words, regardless of their parts of speech \("The Text to Look For"\).
* Capitalise prepositions that are part of a verb phrase \("Backing Up Your Disk"\).
* Do not capitalise articles \(_a_, _an_, _the_\) unless the article is the first word in the title.
* Do not capitalise coordinate conjunctions \(_and_, _but_, _for_, _nor_, _or_, _yet_, _so_\) unless the conjunction is the first word in the title.
* Do not capitalise prepositions of four or fewer letters unless the preposition is the first or the last word in the title.
* Do not capitalise “to” in an infinitive phrase \("How to Format Your Hard Disk"\) unless the phrase is the first word in the title.
* Capitalise the second part of a hyphenated compound if it would be capitalised without the hyphen. Always capitalize the second part of a hyphenated compound if it is the last word of a heading or title.
