# Authoring Lessons

### How does creating lessons work?

go deploy authors create lessons themselves.  The slides, the recordings of demos, the audio is all created by the author. The teams at go deploy will enhance the quality where required and so some post-production, but this is usually minimal.

### Step 1 - The Audition Process

You will need to create a 10 minute video to demonstrate your teaching and delivery skills.  This shows us that you are able to teach a concept well and that you can produce a good quality video.  

You should choose a subject that you intend to propose writing content for.  

You can our content teams a link to the video once complete or upload to a sharing platform such as YouTube.

Once submitted it will go through an approval process as we carefully plan our content requirements. 

Once approved you are ready to start producing your lessons.

### Step 2 - Lesson preparation

First of all, creating a course takes planning. What are you trying to teach?  What is the story line that will help provide context for students?  What topics will you address?  How do you split this up into meaningful lessons?

You should do this planning when you propose a lesson or learning path, as in a course proposal you indicate what the story and outline of the course will be and estimate how long the learning path will be.  

Once you have the overall story, you can start creating lessons. The first lesson of a learning path is usually an introduction, in which you lay out the context of the topics. I usually create this at the very last moment, when all other modules are created. I do this because I usually come to new insights throughout creating the course, and those should be reflected in the first module as well.

Then, its creation time! I always start off with creating the demos. I create what I'm going to teach and set it up to be recorded.

Next, I create the slides to tell the story around the demos.

After that, it's time to create my script. I always write down everything that I'm going to say. For the slides and for the demos. I've tried to "wing it" on the fly, but I just end up forgetting to mention important things or not telling the story that I want.

All of this: creating the slides, text and the demos are my creative process, the rest of the steps is the "work".

### Step 3 - Lesson production
