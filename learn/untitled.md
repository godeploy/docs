Many of you will have already come across the concept of learning paths.  These comprise of multiple modalities giving users a diverse learning experience.

- Lessons (Videos)

- Theory (includes textual content which should reinforce videos and not replace it)

- Hands on labs

- Quiz's (not graded / assessed and more fun)

- Assessments (graded and based on performance based testing)

- Exams (graded and based on theory and/or an assessment)

Once a user has completed a learning path they may earn a badge which can be shared on social media.
