# Authoring Lessons - Top Tips

### 1 Plan your video content. <a id="skipahead"></a>

Believe it or not, the content of your video matters a lot more than its quality.  That being said, it also needs to be of the highest quality ;-\)

That’s not to say quality isn’t important—it sure is! But if you **had** to give one aspect more attention, time and energy, it would be planning your content properly.

To plan your content, consider the following three video tips:

#### 1. Outline your goal

What are you looking to achieve with your video? Define your goal before moving on.

#### 2. Identify your target audience

You can’t possibly target everyone in the world, because then who are you really talking to? Not having a clear vision of your ideal viewer will result in a diluted message within your video content.  Don't deep dive into expert level content if your lesson is targeted towards beginner fundamentals level. 

Your audience will determine the way you write your script, the way you record the video and the way you edit it. 

#### 3. Use the power of emotions

Emotions are what drive viewers to follow through with your call to action.  It’s been proven over and over again that emotions triggered by content are what drive the motivations to carry through with learning.

### 2 Pick the right background.

The background for your video should never be an afterthought. It’ll help tell your story if users can see you. It will also affect the quality of your video.

The choice is really yours but there are two main types:

#### Real Backgrounds

These include a real-life environment such as an office, a living room or an outdoor location. Some people see this option as the easiest because you get to work with what you’ve got. Just make sure it’s not distracting, messy, or has anything that doesn’t contribute to the lesson.

#### Fake Backgrounds

These backgrounds include green screens, curtains, or papers. Fake backgrounds are great for consistency. Green screens are specifically great because they allow you to replace your actual background. However, they are hard to set up and work with, and aren’t recommended for beginner video creators.  Don't get over excited and spend longer on your setup than the actual recording!

Whichever background type you decide to go with, make sure you consciously use the go deploy colours and branding guidelines.  

### 3 You don’t need to buy an expensive, new camera.

Don’t stress too much about which video camera to use.

While you might feel compelled to spend a lot of money on a high-quality video camera, it’s really not necessary. Finding a decent camera to shoot quality videos isn’t hard these days. You probably know someone with a camera you could borrow, or you likely already have one lying around somewhere in your house \(\*hint your mobile phone!\*\).

[For example, this music video was shot entirely with an iPhone X.](https://youtu.be/SEmCu2eXrTc)

Even HD Webcams 1080p give fantastic results.

### 4 Avoid using your camera’s mic.

This is quite simple.  Avoid any built in mics.  Just quickly search on Amazon for a good quality microphone.  They are relatively inexpensive.

If it’s attached to clothing, put it in a place where it picks up all the right sounds \(the person’s voice\), but doesn’t pick up miscellaneous sounds from jewellery, fabric rubbing or heavy breathing. If you’re using a boom, make sure it’s close enough to the subject to pick up your voice, but also be sure it’s out of the frame.

Before filming, always test the sound to make sure you’ve got all of the above set up correctly. For someone with no prior audio experience, that’s usually the only way to make sure you’re getting it right.

### 5 Use natural lighting.

[Video production](https://blog.appsumo.com/youtube-video-editor/) lighting is a whole system that requires more equipment.  Having said that, you can now buy additional lighting online quite cheap.

The good news is natural lighting actually works best in photography and filming, and is the most guaranteed way for you to nail the lighting in your videos.

Again, play with it!

### 6 Film in small segments.

This will save you time and energy while both filming and editing.

It’s much easier to film short takes, since you or your subject will have fewer things to remember and more opportunities to reshoot something you didn’t like. Focusing on segmenting your script into smaller takes will also force you to communicate your message more clearly and concisely.

It will also give you more flexibility in post production to edit the takes however you want to into the final product, and it won’t come out looking choppy.

### 7 Brush up on composition rules.

You’ve probably heard a lot about composition related to still photography, which is equally as important in videography. Composition is the way you choose to frame your subject in the video you’re about to capture. The safest way to frame your subject is to follow the rule of thirds, which divides the frame into a three-by-three grid, creating intersections that are ideal areas to place your subject.

Your subject should be placed at one of the intersections in your viewfinder, and their eyes should line up along the top line in the frame. Framing your subject dead in the center of the frame is usually a poor choice, especially for beginners, because you will end up with a lot of empty space in the top third of the frame. If your subject will vertically be in the center of the photo, at least be sure to align their eyes with the top line.

Mind the head! Don’t have too much space above the subject's head, but don’t cut off the top of their head either. In big dramatic face closeups, if you must cut something off, let it be the top of the subject’s head, not their chins.
