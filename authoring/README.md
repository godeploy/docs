Over 12 months ago, we released, what we called internally, Project Seesaw.  This was a self- service lab creation interface.  The adoption of this service was phenomenally low and feedback from customers included not having time to commit to learning how to build labs and fully test them.  Those customers who did leverage the platform found they needed continual support.  For these reasons we decided to sunset the feature and concentrate our efforts on other features.  This does not mean labs cannot be created.  Please see the [building labs](building-labs.md) article.
