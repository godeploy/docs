# DP-203

DP-203 Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure is a complex course and lab setup.  This article will describe the environment and how to use it effectively.

This course will require strict classroom management to effectively use time.  Some of the lab environments take over 2 hours to fully deploy and labs **CANNOT** **be saved**.  MCTs must fully understand these environments and the time taken to deploy prior to starting a class.  Failing to do so may result in a poorly executed delivery.

Since these environments use commercial Azure subscriptions, each resource is billed for consumption. Should students or instructors go outside of the scope of the course or try to change the SKU/Size of any resources, the resources will be deleted and be unrecoverable.

**Lab Environments**  
  
There are 4 lab environments for DP-203:

* Environment 1 - Used for modules 1,6,15 and 17
  * _resource deployment takes approx 15 minutes_
  * _Default lab time is 3 hours and can be extended if required_
* Environment 2 - Used for module 2
  * _resource deployment takes approx 15 minutes_
  * _default lab time is 3 hours and can be extended if required_
* Environment 3 - Used for modules 4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 and 16
  * _resource deployment takes approx 2 hours_
  * _default lab time is 7 hours and can be extended if required_
* Environment 4 - Used for module 4
  * _resource deployment takes approx 15 minutes_
  * _default lab time is 3 hours and can be extended if required_

As you can see, some of the labs take up to 2 hours to deploy all the resources.  This is why classroom/time management is key to the success of this course.  It is recommended that labs are started at the beginning of the day or prior to breaks and/or lectures to ensure the resources are fully deployed and databases seeded with the required data.
