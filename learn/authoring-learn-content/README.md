# Authoring Learn Content

### Basics

Every modality, be it a lesson, lab, quiz etc should have the following:

* Title
* Intro \(~ 30 words\)
* Level
* Platform / Discipline

See the following for an outline of each.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Title" %}
The title gives the user a quick and easy identifier as to what the content will deliver.

**Examples**:  

_Getting started with GCP Compute  
Business continuity and disaster recovery using AWS  
Securing Azure Web Apps -_
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Intro" %}
The intro gives a brief explanation to the content

**Examples**:  

_Getting started with GCP Compute **- In this lab you will learn how to create Compute instances on Google Cloud Platform.**  
Business continuity and disaster recovery using AWS - **In this lesson you will learn how to design, implement and manage Business continuity and disaster recovery using the CloudEndure.**  
Securing Azure Web Apps - **In this lab you will explore and implement the security features available for Azure Web Apps \(Paas\).**_
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Level" %}
| Level | Code | Explanation and/or Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Foundational | 100 | Explains the basic concept |
| Intermediate | 200 | Expands on the basic concepts but does not duplicate |
| Associate | 300 | Advanced technical detail |
| Expert | 400 | Highly technical with depth to the content |
| Deep Dive | 500 | Deeply technical and usually is a much longer duration than the above |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Platform / Discipline" %}
Tags are used through our Learn platform to easily identify content but more importantly to make the search feature a much richer experience.  

Examples below:

_Getting started with GCP Compute - **GCP, Fundamentals, Compute**  
Business continuity and disaster recovery using AWS - **AWS, Disaster Recovery, Backup, Backups**  
Securing Azure Web Apps - **Azure, PaaS, Web Apps, Security**_
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
