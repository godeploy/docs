# Authoring Labs

### **Labs**

All labs should follow a standard format when being written.  This is to give users a consistent experience regardless of vendor or subject.

All courses should have the following

A Title - _This should outline exactly what the lab is about_

Scenario - _The scenario should set the scene for the lab and exercises_

Objectives - _Objectives state what the user will learn_ 

Exercises - _Labs should be broken down into exercises which lead on from one another._

Tasks - _Multiple tasks are grouped together to form exercises_

Conclusion - _At the end of each exercise and at the end of the lab you should conclude._
