# Ordering Labs

The self service ordering of labs is a feature enabled for organisations to purchase labs directly from go deploy.  In order to do this they must have completed an onboarding process.  Once this has been completed the following process will guide you through how to order labs.

1. Once you have been granted permissions for your organisation you should log back into the LMS at [https://lms.godeploy.it](https://lms.godeploy.it/)

**Note**: If your organisation has a custom portal simply login using that URL.

In the top right hand corner you will see the new Business Unit icon \(small tower building icon\).  Select this and select **Manage -** _**Your organisation name**_.

10. You will see an entry for every item you added to your order.  You have two options: 

**View Key**: This enables you to view which students have redeemed a key once issued.  
**Email Key**: This enables you to send an email with the access instructions to a user/instructor or yourself.

12. The screen below shows the screen when you choose **Email Key**.  Enter an email address you wish to send the lab access instructions to and click the green "+" symbol. This will then add the email to the list of people you wish to send the lab key to. You can add as many email addresses as you wish. Once you have added a list of email addresses simply click "Send" and the email will be sent immediately.
