# Azure Restrictions \(COVID-19\)

Some classes are currently facing issues whereby they are sporadically unable to create/deploy resources in Azure or deployments fail when using an Azure Pass subscription.  

Microsoft have made the following announcement:

_**As demand continues to grow, if we are faced with any capacity constraints in any region during this time, we have established clear criteria for the priority of new cloud capacity. Top priority will be going to first responders, health and emergency management services, critical government infrastructure organizational use, and ensuring remote workers stay up and running with the core functionality of Teams. We will also consider adjusting free offers, as necessary, to ensure support of existing customers.**_  

The full statement from Microsoft can be read [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/our-commitment-to-customers-and-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/).

We are currently working on a permanent solution which will remove the requirement for Azure Passes, however this is 3 - 4 weeks away from being operational due to QA and testing requirements internally. Rest assured we are trying to accelerate this deployment internally.

As a workaround you may create a paid for subscription which has a higher priority in Azure and share that amongst students or alternatively continue to use the Azure Passes and attempt to deploy resources in alternative regions.

Obviously this situation is completely outside of our control and we are doing all we can to ensure the smooth running of classes.
