### **Power menu**

The power menu enables you to turn On / Off and force reboot Virtual Machines.

You also have the ability to reset the gateway machine that is hidden from users but provides internet connectivity. Rebooting the gateway takes around 30 seconds therefore it is advised that you do not keep sending the reset command or the virtual machine will never complete booting.
